---

Kawaii-San currently in very early development, so don't expect too much... yet.
It has not yet been tested in multiple guilds at once, and probably would not work properly if it was. Because of that,
it is currently **not accessible**.
Also, most of the assets are placeholders. I will try not to rely on Genshin Impact & Mashin-D≈çru wa Kizutsukanai
fanarts in the future.
*(Mihoyo, Reiji, please don't sue me for using them for now)*

# Features

- Selfrole command with buttons and custom emojis
- Two-way Minecraft and Discord chat integration after installing a plugin on the server. (The plugin not accessible yet)
- Right click to hug a user, if they have a bad day :)

# In Development / Planned

- Tempban
- Web UI
- AI chat with custom personalities
- Music player
- And much more things I can't even think of right now :) Keep your fingers crossed for me!

# Building

Download the source code using

```bash
git clone https://github.com/javatrix/kawaiisanbot
```

cd into the directory and run

```bash
./gradlew shadowJar
```

This will create a runnable JAR file in the build/libs directory.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:
FOR THE BOT TO RUN CORRECTLY, IT NEEDS THE GRADLE.PROPERTIES FILE IN THE RUNNING DIRECTORY.**
